# Progress Tracker

*This file tracks the overall progress, current status, and known issues of the project.*

## Current Status

*Initial project analysis and documentation update complete. Memory Bank and `.clinerules` have been populated based on analysis of the existing codebase.*

## What Works

*   Core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) are populated with initial details based on project analysis.
*   `.clinerules` file is updated with specific project conventions and technical details (TypeScript, Yarn, Storybook, local v86, etc.).
*   Basic understanding of the project architecture (React components, hooks, web worker, Zstd WASM) is documented in `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md`.

## What's Left to Build / Implement

*   Refine Memory Bank and `.clinerules` further as development progresses or more detailed requirements are provided.
*   Address any placeholders or TBD sections in the documentation (e.g., specific commit message format, branching strategy).
*   Implement or enhance features of the `V86` React component based on project goals.
*   Add more specific tests (potentially beyond Storybook if needed).

## Known Issues & Bugs

*(Track any identified bugs, limitations, or areas needing improvement. Include steps to reproduce if possible.)*

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*(Document significant changes in direction, scope, or technical approach over time. Link back to `projectbrief.md` or other relevant context.)*
